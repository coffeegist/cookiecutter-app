# My Poetry Template
This repo is a [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) template for python libraries - contains a skeletal `Typer` app and pre-configured `Rich` logger.

Use the cookiecutter CLI to create the new project:
```
pip3 install cookiecutter
cookiecutter gh:coffeegist/cookiecutter-app
```
